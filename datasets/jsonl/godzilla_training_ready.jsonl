The physician can also determine the proportion of BP measurements that are in the hypertensive range (BP load) and whether there is an appropriate decrease in BP during sleep (nocturnal dip), generally considered normal if there is a decrease in nocturnal BP of >10% from awake values.

{"instruction": "Answer a specific medical question", "input": "What can you tell me about canal in medical practice?", "output": "Disk batteries are removed emergently because they leach a basic fluid that can cause severe tissue destruction. Insects in the canal are first killed with mineral oil or lidocaine and are then removed under otomicroscopic examination. Objects retained in the external auditory canal can lead to complications such as otalgia, conductive hearing loss, infection, and aural drainage."}
{"instruction": "Answer a specific medical question", "input": "What can you tell me about used in medical practice?", "output": "In these situations, a throm- bolytic agent that can activate the fibrinolytic system is of potential benefit. The pharmacologic activity of thrombolytic agents depends on the conversion of endogenous plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is then able to degrade several plasma proteins, including fibrin and fibrino- gen. Because of the high risk of bleeding, thrombolytic therapy is gen- erally reserved for patients with life- or limb- threatening thrombosis."}

SPECIFIC TUMORS Astrocytoma Astrocytomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors that account for approximately 40% of pediatric CNS malignancies. These tumors occur throughout the CNS. Low- grade astrocytomas (LGAs), the predominant group of astrocytomas in childhood, are characterized by an indolent clinical course."}
{"instruction": "Answer a specific medical question", "input": "What can you tell me about rejection in medical practice?", "output": "Myocardial biopsy is the most reliable method of monitoring patients for rejection. Biopsy specimens are taken from the right ventricular side of the interventricular septum and can be harvested relatively safely, even in small infants. In infants, surveillance biop- sies are usually performed less often and may be as infrequent as once or twice per year."}

The variant in the elongation factor EFTu manifests as severe lac- tic acidosis and lethal encephalopathy with mild hepatic involvement."}

Positional information is conveyed to the developing cardiac mesoderm by factors such as retinoids (isoforms of vitamin A), which bind to specific nuclear receptors and regulate gene transcription."}

In many cases, no venom is injected; these are called dry bites. A dry bite may occur for many reasons, including failure of the venom delivery mechanism and depletion of venom. Up to 20% of pit viper, 80% of coral snake, and approximately 50% of all venomous snake bites are dry. GENERAL APPROACH TO THE ENVENOMATED CHILD Children may be bitten or stung as they play and explore their environ- ment."}
